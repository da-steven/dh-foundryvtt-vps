Yes â€” **setting up a firewall and fail2ban is strongly recommended** even for a single-instance Oracle VPS running Foundry VTT via Docker. While Foundry itself may be proxied through a Cloudflare tunnel and not exposed directly to the public internet, the **VPS is still at risk** for SSH brute-force attempts, port scans, and other common attacks.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of your options and why you might consider them:

---

## âœ… Recommended Security Layers

### 1. **Firewall (UFW or iptables/nftables)**

Purpose: Control which ports/services are accessible externally.

**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** is recommended for ease of use:

```bash
# Install and enable
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH and Foundry (via Cloudflare tunnel only uses localhost)
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Check status
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**Notes:**

* Since Foundry is accessed via a Cloudflare tunnel (which connects over localhost), no need to expose port 30000 publicly.
* You could optionally restrict outbound traffic too, but that requires more caution (e.g., allowing updates, DNS, tunnel).

---

### 2. **fail2ban**

Purpose: Ban IPs that attempt brute-force login or other suspicious patterns.

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
```

The default jail protects SSH. You can optionally tweak settings in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`:

```ini
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
findtime = 10m
bantime = 1h
```

Restart with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

Verify settings:
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```

## ðŸ”’ Optional Enhancements

### 3. **SSH Hardening**

* Change default port from 22 (security through obscurity).
* Disable password auth, use SSH keys only.
* Use `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` to restrict logins.

### 4. **Root Access**

* Disable root login over SSH (`PermitRootLogin no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).

### 5. **Cloudflare Tunnel Only**

Make sure your Foundry container is **only listening on `127.0.0.1`**, not `0.0.0.0`, to avoid accidental public exposure.
